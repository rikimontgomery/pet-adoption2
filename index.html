    <h1>Monsters Seeking Loving Home</h1>
    <div class="column">
      <img class="mi-go" src="img/Mi-go.jpg" alt="Photo of Mi-go">
      <h2>Mi-go</h2>
      <p><span class="mi-go-p hidden">Not all Lovecraftian monsters are gods or god-like entities, some of them are just straight up aliens, like the Mi-go. Made of some unnatural substance that doesn’t even occur on Earth, the Mi-go are like a gross cross between a fungus and a lobster, with batwings that let them fly from Earth to Pluto and even further away. Seeing as they worship (or at least revere) noted jerks Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath, it should come as no surprise that the Mi-go are kind of vicious and terrible. In fact, they waged a massive war against the Elder Things long before humans ever walked the Earth.</span></p>

    <div class="column">
      <img src="img/Kassogtha.jpg" alt="Photo of Kassogtha" class="kassogtha">
      <h2>Kassogtha</h2>

      <p><span class="kassogtha-p hidden">To find lesser-known, but still awesomely terrible Lovecraftian Great Old Ones, you don’t even need to travel outside of Cthulhu’s disconcertingly unforked family tree. That’s because Kassogtha, the big writhing pile of tentacles you see above, is both Cthulhu’s sister and mate. Together, they had two precious baby girls, Nctosa and Nctolhu. Between being the product of incest and those names, I’m sure they had a terrible time in middle school.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="img/Shub-Niggurath.jpg" alt="Photo of Shub-Niggurath" class="shub">
      <h2>Shub-Niggurath</h2>
      <p><span class="shub-p hidden">Unlike other Lovecraftian monsters and gods that actually show up in the author’s stories, Shub-Niggurath is pretty much just referenced in passing. Most of what we know about her — that’s right, she identifies as female — actually comes from stories that Lovecraft ghost wrote under different names, the contents of his letters or the subsequent Cthulhu Mythos writings of other authors. Where Lovecraft does speak of Shub-Niggurath though, he refers to her as both “The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young” as well as an “evil cloud-like entity,” which is absolutely terrifyingly badass enough for me.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="img/Ghast.jpg" alt="Photo of Ghast" class="ghast">
      <h2>Ghast</h2>
      <p><span class="ghast-p hidden">When most people think of Lovecraftian monsters, they mostly restrict themselves to the Great Old Ones, Outer Gods, Elder Gods, Great Ones, and so on. That’s a crying shame though, because Lovecraft’s Dream Cycle also has a bunch of totally bonkers monsters in it. To wit, the Ghast. They’re humanoid, but with no nose or forehead. What they do have are a pair of hooved kangaroo legs, which they bounce around on in search of tender, delectable Gugs.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="img/Gug.jpg" alt="Photo of Gug" class="gug">
      <h2>Gug</h2>
      <p><span class="gug-p hidden">They might be Ghast food, but Gugs are still pretty serious customers, having been banished to the underworld for some terrible offense against the Great Ones. They’re giant monsters that live in humongous towers in underground towers. And as if that wasn’t bad enough, they’ve got arms that split into multiple forearms with massive talons at the end and big toothy maws that open vertically, unlike normal, reasonable, non-madness inducing horizontal mouths.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="img/Brown-Jenkin.jpg" alt="Photo of Brown Jenkin" class= "jenkin">
      <h2>Brown Jenkin</h2>
      <p><span class="jenkin-p hidden">Some of my favorite Lovecraft stories deal not so much with the Lovecraftian gods themselves, but with the monsters that they spawn. A great example of this is “The Dreams in the Witch House,” featuring Keziah Mason, an old witch who was subjected to the infamous Salem Witch Trials. Brown Jenkin is Mason’s familiar, a hairy, rat-like thing with a vaguely human face and hands. It fed on the blood of Mason, who some readers speculate was also Jenkin’s mother, having been impregnated by Nyarlathotep.</span></p>
